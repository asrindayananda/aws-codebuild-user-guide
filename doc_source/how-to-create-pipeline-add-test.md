# Add a CodeBuild test action to a pipeline \(CodePipeline console\)<a name="how-to-create-pipeline-add-test"></a>

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console by using:
   + Your AWS root account\. This is not recommended\. For more information, see [The account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
   + An administrator IAM user in your AWS account\. For more information, see [Creating your first IAM admin user and group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
   + An IAM user in your AWS account with permission to perform the following minimum set of actions:

     ```
     codepipeline:*
     iam:ListRoles
     iam:PassRole
     s3:CreateBucket
     s3:GetBucketPolicy
     s3:GetObject
     s3:ListAllMyBuckets
     s3:ListBucket
     s3:PutBucketPolicy
     codecommit:ListBranches
     codecommit:ListRepositories
     codedeploy:GetApplication
     codedeploy:GetDeploymentGroup
     codedeploy:ListApplications
     codedeploy:ListDeploymentGroups
     elasticbeanstalk:DescribeApplications
     elasticbeanstalk:DescribeEnvironments
     lambda:GetFunctionConfiguration
     lambda:ListFunctions
     opsworks:DescribeStacks
     opsworks:DescribeApps
     opsworks:DescribeLayers
     ```

1. Open the CodePipeline console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home)\.

1. In the AWS region selector, choose the AWS Region where your pipeline is located\. This must be an AWS Region where CodeBuild is supported\. For more information, see [AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#codebuild_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

1. On the **Pipelines** page, choose the name of the pipeline\.

1. On the pipeline details page, in the **Source** action, choose the tooltip\. Make a note of the value for **Output artifact** \(for example, **MyApp**\)\.
**Note**  
This procedure shows you how to add a test action inside of a test stage between the **Source** and **Beta** stages\. If you want to add the test action somewhere else, rest your mouse pointer on the action just before, and make a note of the value for **Output artifact**\.

1. Choose **Edit**\.

1. Immediately after the **Source** stage, choose **Add stage**\.
**Note**  
This procedure shows you how to add a test stage immediately after the **Source** stage to your pipeline\. To add a test action to an existing stage, choose **Edit stage** in the stage, and then skip to step 8 of this procedure\. To add the test stage somewhere else, choose **Add stage** in the desired place\.

1. For **Stage name**, enter the name of the test stage \(for example, **Test**\)\. If you choose a different name, use it throughout this procedure\.

1. In the selected stage, choose **Add action**\.
**Note**  
This procedure shows you how to add the test action in a test stage\. To add the test action somewhere else, choose **Add action** in the desired place\. You might first need to choose **Edit** in the existing stage where you want to add the test action\.

1. In **Edit action**, for **Action name**, enter a name for the action \(for example, **Test**\)\. If you choose a different name, use it throughout this procedure\.

1. For **Action provider**, under **Test**, choose **CodeBuild**\.

1. If you already have a build project you want to use, for **Project name**, choose the name of the build project and skip to the next step in this procedure\.

   If you need to create a new CodeBuild build project, follow the instructions in [Create a build project \(console\)](create-project-console.md) and return to this procedure\.
**Important**  
If you enable webhooks for a CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step in CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each commit\. One build is triggered through webhooks and one through CodePipeline\. Because billing is on a per\-build basis, you are billed for both builds\. Therefore, if you are using CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in CodeBuild\. In the CodeBuild console, clear the **Webhook**box\. For more information, see [Change a build project's settings \(console\)](change-project-console.md)

1. For **Input artifacts**, select the value for **Output artifact** that you noted earlier in this procedure\.

1. \(Optional\) If you want your test action to produce an output artifact, and you set up your buildspec accordingly, then for **Output artifact**, enter the value you want to assign to the output artifact\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Choose **Release change**\.

1. After the pipeline runs successfully, you can get the test results\. In the **Test** stage of the pipeline, choose the **CodeBuild** hyperlink to open the related build project page in the CodeBuild console\.

   

1. On the build project page, in **Build history**, choose the **Build run** hyperlink\.

1. On the build run page, in **Build logs**, choose the **View entire log** hyperlink to open the build log in the Amazon CloudWatch console\.

1. Scroll through the build log to view the test results\.
